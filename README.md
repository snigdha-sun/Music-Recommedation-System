"# Music-Recommendation-System" - This Music Recommendation System is designed to suggest songs based on a user's mood, detected through text input. The project includes a Streamlit-based web app (app.py) that takes user input, analyzes sentiment using NLTK, and predicts moods like Happy, Sad, Relaxed, and Energetic using a RandomForestClassifier model. The system is built on a pre-cleaned dataset (spotify_cleaned.csv) containing key song features like valence, energy, and danceability. The trained models, saved as estimator.pkl and Trained_Model.sav, enable quick and accurate predictions. A Jupyter Notebook (spotify_radio_projecttt.ipynb) details the data preprocessing steps, model training, and performance evaluations. To give a structured overview, a PowerPoint presentation (Spotify_rahul_inno.pptx) outlines the approach, implementation, and potential future improvements. To upload everything to GitHub, the files need to be added to a repository, committed, and pushed using Git commands. To ensure a seamless experience, updating README.md with setup instructions, dependencies (requirements.txt), and usage guidelines is essential. Lastly, running and testing app.py on Streamlit ensures that the system performs as expected, providing personalized music recommendations based on user sentiment.
